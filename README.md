# UsingNewman
 What I Did:
1. Designed and organized API test cases in Postman
2. Exported the collection and ran tests using Newman
3. Integrated simple test assertions for response status and body validation
4. Generated HTML reports for visibility
5. Built a strong foundation for CI/CD integration in the future

**Tools Used:**

1. Postman

2. Newman CLI

3. JavaScript (for test scripting)

4. HTML Reporter

5. GitHub for version control

**Challenges**
I noticed once i ran the workflow after an hour, I had to generate my token again to avoid failure of the test scripts.
